# ML-Agent: Reinforcing LLM Agents for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering  
**An LLM Agent Trained to Outperform 671B Models with Only 9 Tasks**

[ML-Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23723) is an autonomous agent capable of performing end-to-end machine learning engineering, built upon a **7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM** and trained using a novel **agentic ML training framework**. This marks the first work where an LLM agent learns from interactive experimentation in ML environments through **online reinforcement learning (RL)** ‚Äî going beyond heuristic or prompt-based designs.

Key components of the training framework include:
- **Exploration-enriched fine-tuning**: Enhances action diversity for better RL exploration.
- **Step-wise RL**: Enables fast and stable training through single-step optimization.
- **Agentic ML-specific reward design**: Integrates multi-modal feedback into unified rewards.

Remarkably, despite being trained on only **9 ML tasks**, ML-Agent **outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent**, and shows strong cross-task generalization abilities.

## üß† Machine Learning Tasks
In our paper, we organize 9 training tasks (held-in) for both exploration-enriched fine-tuning and step-wise reinforcement learning(RL) and 10 tasks (held-out) for further evaluation. All tasks all collected from [MLAgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03302) (MLA) and [MLEBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095) (MLE). 

The tasks are listed as follows:

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Training.** For exploration-enriched fine-tuning, we use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) codebase; for step-wise RL, we use [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) codebase. Please follow the instructions in the respective repositories to set up the environment for training.

- **Evaluation.** For environment to evaluate the agents on different machine learning tasks, please follow the instructions below: ```
pip install -r eval_requirements.txt```. Despite this, machine learning tasks are executed in another environment. You can use the following command to create a new conda environment mlagentbench:
    ```
    conda create -n mlagentbench python=3.10
    conda activate mlagentbench
    pip install -r mlagent_requirements.txt
    ```
