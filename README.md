## Machine Learning Tasks
In our paper, we organize 9 training tasks (held-in) for both exploration-enriched fine-tuning and step-wise reinforcement learning(RL) and 10 tasks (held-out) for further evaluation. All tasks all collected from [MLAgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03302) (MLA) and [MLEBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095) (MLE). 

The tasks are listed as follows:

**Key outcomes**:
- üöÄ **ML-Agent achieves superior performance across both held-in and held-out tasks.**: Trained on **9 tasks** with **7B Qwen-2.5 model**, outperforms other 5 baselines, e.g. **671B DeepSeek-R1**. (Table 1)
- üî• **ML-Agent outperforms stat-of-the-art agents.**: Comparing with AIDE-based agents (AIDE-4o, AIDE-o1, AIDE-r1), ML-Agent achieves best performance on most 11 tasks. (Figure 3)
- ‚ö° **ML-Agent achieves continuous performance improvements.**: As training progresses, performance of ML-Agent increases. (Figure 4)


## Requirements
- **Training.** For exploration-enriched fine-tuning, we use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) codebase; for step-wise RL, we use [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) codebase. Please follow the instructions in the respective repositories to set up the environment for training.

- **Evaluation.** For environment to evaluate the agents on different machine learning tasks, please follow the instructions below: ```
pip install -r eval_requirements.txt```. Despite this, machine learning tasks are executed in another environment. You can use the following command to create a new conda environment mlagentbench:
    ```
    conda create -n mlagentbench python=3.10
    conda activate mlagentbench
    pip install -r mlagent_requirements.txt
    ```



## Training
### Exploration-enriched Fine-tuning
The base model for fine-tuning is Qwen2.5-7B, you can dowonload here [Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B).
```
bash scripts/train_step1.sh
```
### Step-wise Reinforcement Learning
RL is trained on the fine-tuned model from step 1.
```
bash scripts/train_step2.sh
```

## Evaluation
We evaluate on 3 held-in tasks (cifar-10, house-price, feedback) and 10 held-out tasks.
```
bash scripts/eval.sh
```
You can specific the evaluation task and the model checkpoint by setting the following parameters in the script ```scripts/eval.sh```.
